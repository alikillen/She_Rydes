[Deployed Website Heroku](www.sherydesapp.herokuapp.com) (in need of some updating/debugging still...)


## Project Description
This project is a MERN full-stack web application which we developed as a part of our final Coder Academy Bootcamp assignment. Throughout this project we worked as a team of two junior developers and developed an e-commerce store where users (customers) can sign in, browse and view products, and learn about the brand She Rydes. The seller (client) is also an admin on the site and has full authorization to manage the website and make changes in the listings.

## Purpose
She Rydes is a real world project and the client aims to bring a convenient and affordable place for people and specifically female customers to purchase their motorcycle riding apparrel. The client needs a fast, well-designed responsive website that reflects their brand and has detailed eCommerce functionality, allowing customers to browse and purchase apparel with ease.
